## ðŸ›  Overview

This is a **work-in-progress** tool designed to analyze Java projects, generate concise descriptions, and answer questions about the project using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** technology.

### âœ¨ Features (So Far)
- âœ… Extracts **classes, methods, and API endpoints** from Java projects.
- âœ… Generates **summaries** explaining each fileâ€™s purpose.
- âœ… Stores extracted knowledge in a **vector database** for retrieval.
- âœ… Allows **natural language queries** about the project.

### ðŸ”¥ Upcoming Features
- [ ] **Support for more languages** (e.g., Python, JavaScript)
- [ ] **Better API documentation parsing**
- [ ] **More accurate project type detection (CLI, Web App, etc.)**

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. **Extract Code Structure**: Analyzes Java/Kotlin files to find classes, methods, and API endpoints.
2. **Summarization**: Uses OpenAIâ€™s models to generate a description.
3. **Knowledge Storage**: Saves the structured summaries in a **vector database**.
4. **Query Engine**: Lets you ask questions like _"What does this project do?"_
